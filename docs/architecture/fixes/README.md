# Architecture Fix Notes

This directory is the registry for resolved architecture bugs and structural lessons.

Use it to preserve learning that should become part of the repository's long-term memory instead of staying in chat threads, commits, or PR comments.

## What Counts As An Architecture Bug

Create an entry here when the real root cause was related to:

- package boundaries or ownership,
- BFF or client responsibilities,
- domain or infrastructure layering,
- contracts, schemas, DTO flow, or cross-service coupling,
- monorepo wiring, build orchestration, or dependency structure,
- persistence or migration design,
- repeated structural decisions that can reintroduce the same class of failure.

## Rules

- Keep entries in English.
- Create one file per architecture root cause.
- Use the filename format `YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug.md`.
- Start new entries from `TEMPLATE.md`.
- Add the newest entry to the top of the index below.
- If the fix also produced reusable operational lessons, cross-link a supporting note in `docs/learning-log/` instead of duplicating the same narrative.
- If the fix changes a stable workflow or architecture rule, also update the relevant document in `docs/features/`, `docs/waves/`, `docs/AI-context.md`, or `README.md`.
