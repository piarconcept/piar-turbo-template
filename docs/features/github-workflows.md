# GitHub CI/CD Workflows

**Status**: ✅ Active  
**Created**: 2026-01-15  
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-27

## Overview

This document describes the GitHub Actions workflows configured for continuous integration and deployment in this repository.

## Workflows

### CI - Verify (`ci.yml`)

**Trigger**:

- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests to `main` branch

**Purpose**: Runs complete verification of the entire monorepo to ensure code quality and functionality.

**Steps**:

1. **Checkout code** - Checks out the repository code
2. **Setup Node.js 20** - Installs Node.js version 20
3. **Install pnpm 10.28.0** - Installs the exact pnpm version used in the project
4. **Setup pnpm cache** - Caches pnpm store for faster subsequent runs
5. **Install dependencies** - Runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
6. **Run verification** - Executes `pnpm verify` which runs:
   - Install dependencies
   - Build all packages
   - Type checking
   - Formatting check
   - Tests with coverage
   - Linting
7. **Upload coverage** - Uploads coverage reports as artifacts (30 days retention)

**Environment**:

- Runner: `ubuntu-latest`
- Node.js: `20`
- pnpm: `10.28.0`

**Caching Strategy**:

- Caches pnpm store based on `pnpm-lock.yaml` hash
- Reduces installation time on subsequent runs
- Fallback to latest cache if exact match not found

**Artifacts**:

- Coverage reports stored for 30 days
- Accessible from workflow run summary

## Usage

### Running Locally

To run the same checks that CI runs:

```bash
pnpm verify
```

This executes the `scripts/verify-all.sh` script which performs all verification steps.

### Monitoring CI

1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Select the "CI - Verify" workflow
4. View the latest runs and their status

### Pull Request Checks

All pull requests to `main` will automatically trigger the CI workflow. The PR cannot be merged unless all checks pass.

## Configuration Files

- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Verification Script**: `scripts/verify-all.sh`
- **Package Scripts**: `package.json` (root)

## Best Practices

1. **Always run `pnpm verify` locally** before pushing to ensure CI will pass
2. **Check CI logs** if a build fails to understand what went wrong
3. **Keep dependencies updated** to avoid security vulnerabilities
4. **Monitor coverage reports** to maintain code quality

## Troubleshooting

### CI Fails on Install

- Check if `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed
- Ensure Node.js version matches (20)
- Verify pnpm version matches (10.28.0)

### CI Fails on Build

- Run `pnpm build` locally to reproduce
- Check TypeScript errors
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

### CI Fails on Tests

- Run `pnpm test:coverage -- --run` locally
- Check test failures in the logs
- Ensure tests don't depend on local environment

### CI Fails on Lint

- Run `pnpm lint` locally
- Fix linting errors
- Consider running `pnpm lint --fix` for auto-fixable issues

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **Deployment Workflows** - Add CD workflows for automatic deployment
2. **Preview Deployments** - Deploy PR previews automatically
3. **Performance Testing** - Add performance benchmarks
4. **Security Scanning** - Add dependency vulnerability scanning
5. **Matrix Testing** - Test on multiple Node.js versions
6. **Parallel Jobs** - Split tests across multiple jobs for faster execution

## Maintenance

- Update Node.js and pnpm versions as needed
- Adjust caching strategy if build times increase
- Monitor artifact storage usage
