# AI Context - PIAR Monorepo

Start here. This file is the canonical index and rules for documentation and development decisions.

## Repository language policy

- The entire repository must be in English unless content is a translation for the website in other languages.

## Documentation Guidelines (CRITICAL)

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All determinant decisions, architectural choices, and project rules must live in `docs/`.
2. **Mandatory updates**: When you change structure, architecture, workflows, tooling, or conventions, update the relevant docs.
3. **Structure**:
   - `docs/AI-context.md` = master index and rules
   - `docs/concept/` = folder-based product concept, discovery questions, app ownership, product decisions, and build-plan inputs
   - `docs/features/` = detailed docs per topic
   - `docs/waves/` = multi-agent execution wave plans, templates, and dated prompt batches
   - `docs/architecture/fixes/` = resolved architecture bugs and structural lessons
   - `docs/learning-log/` = resolved incidents, regressions, and non-obvious fixes
4. **Naming**: Use kebab-case filenames (e.g., `authentication-flow.md`).
5. **Index maintenance**: Update this index whenever a doc is added/removed.
6. **Architecture learning capture**: Every resolved architecture bug must be documented in `docs/architecture/fixes/`.
7. **Operational learning capture**: Any non-trivial fix, incident, workaround, or reusable debugging lesson that is not primarily architectural must be logged in `docs/learning-log/`.

## Quick Reference

### Defining a Product Concept

1. Read `concept/initial-questions/README.md`
2. Ask unanswered initial questions before changing template identity or product assumptions
3. Read `concept/Readme.md`
4. Fill the concept folders from product idea to build plan
5. Track unresolved product questions in `concept/questions/open-questions.md`
6. Create implementation waves only after the first build scope is clear
7. Keep concept docs aligned when product intent changes during implementation

### Creating a New Component

1. Read `features/component-library-development-guide.md`
2. Identify duplication (3+ uses)
3. Choose level: atom/molecule/organism
4. Create in `packages/ui/components/src/{level}/`
5. Export in index.ts
6. Build and document

### Creating a New Feature

1. Read `concept/Readme.md` when the feature depends on product assumptions
2. Read `features/creating-features-guide.md`
3. Read `features/template-baseline-and-feature-migration.md`
4. Read `features/waves-workflow.md`
5. Create or update `docs/waves/` when the feature is larger than a tiny linear fix
6. Create required layers (`domain`, `fields`, `repositories`, feature packages, BFF wiring)
7. Follow Clean Architecture
8. Document in `docs/features/`
9. Update this index

### Creating a New Package

1. Read `features/creating-packages.md`
2. Follow the 14 steps
3. Document in `docs/features/`
4. Update this index

### Documenting an Important Fix

1. Read `features/context-engineering-protocol.md`
2. If the root cause is architectural, create or update a note in `docs/architecture/fixes/`
3. If the fix is non-architectural but reusable, create or update a note in `docs/learning-log/`
4. Use the matching template in that directory
5. Update the relevant wave plan if the work was executed through multi-agent prompts
6. Update the relevant feature doc if the fix changes long-term behavior
7. Update this index only when docs are added or removed

## Before Making Changes

1. Check `features/repository-configuration.md`
2. Read `concept/initial-questions/README.md` and ask unanswered required questions before initializing a product, replacing template identity, choosing apps, changing database configuration, or starting product features
3. Review `docs/concept/` when changing product assumptions, app surfaces, domain language, or build scope
4. Review relevant docs in `docs/features/`
5. Review `docs/waves/` when planning or resuming feature work, multi-agent execution, or staged migrations
6. Review `docs/architecture/fixes/` when working on a repeated or structural failure
7. Review `docs/learning-log/` when working on a repeated or unclear operational failure
8. Update docs after changes
